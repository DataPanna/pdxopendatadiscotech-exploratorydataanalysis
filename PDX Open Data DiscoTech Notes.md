### Portland Neighborhood Data Exploration
- 2 years in the making; combining City data with Census data to see how neighborhoods are evolving
- City and PSU are actually generating data about neighborhoods
- Portland neighborhood profiles: Beyond the blocks
    - Ethan Sharygin (PSU)
- Background/Motivation
    - 2000 & 2010 Profiles: Civil Life Partnership
        - DP Concerns
        - Developing a 2020 plan

## Main Event on Saturday, 3/25/2023
### Intro: Hector Dominguez
- Open Data is a goal to highlight transparency efforts in Government
- Connecting Government Data to Community Members can help Government Staff tackle the problems most important to citizens
- Problem Statement for Today: Identify places City's Open Data Sets are missing data necessary for beneficial analysis
- Primary Flow of Event:
    - Day is split into 2 pieces
        1. Try to find an interesting question; put together a list of subjects
        2. Teams Demo and report back
    - Break Out Meetings
        - If a separate break out room is needed, Hector can create them for us

### Project Work: Exploring Portland Neighborhood Data
#### Notes from Project Page: https://www.democracylab.org/events/101/projects/1173
Problem
Navigating socio-economic data can be complex and requires certain expertise to build narratives of social dynamics through data. This team will be exploring how to facilitate accessing Portland neighborhood data.
Data sources:

Hackathon Goal
Participants are encourage to develop tools that facilitate exploration, visualizations, or processing of the Portland neighborhood data (1.0).

All types of tools are welcome, from spreadsheets to standalone apps.
